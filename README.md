# restaurent_website

This project is based upon a simple website for a restaurant. Through
this website the customers can keep track of whatever menus is being
presented at the restaurant. The customers can check the website to
refer to prices of the different cuisines available in the restaurant. Also,
through this website the customers can refer to small blogs about the
different types of food available at our restaurant. The customers can
also subscribe to the website so that we can send our newsletters to
them to keep them updated. This website wonâ€™t allow the user to order
food from the restaurant, it is just for displaying purpose to keep in
touch with the customers.
